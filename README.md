### ***task distribution :***
### Member 1: The Data Engineer & ResNet Lead
|--->Done by : Malak Alaa Mohamed       
--->Primary Responsibility: Data Pipeline & ResNet Implementation.

    Technical Tasks:

        Data Preparation: Download Stanford Cars dataset. Write scripts for data cleaning, resizing (e.g., 224x224), and normalization.

        Data Splitting: Create the standard Train/Validation/Test split.

        Model Implementation: Implement ResNet (Pre-trained) using Transfer Learning. Freeze base layers, modify the fully connected head for 196 classes, and fine-tune.

    Documentation: Write the "Data Preprocessing" section and the "ResNet Architecture & Results" section (including referencing the He et al. paper).
### Member 2: The Architect (VGG-19 From Scratch)
|---> Done by :karim ehab      
   ---> Primary Responsibility: Building VGG-19 from the ground up.

    Technical Tasks:

        VGG-19 Implementation: Code the entire VGG-19 architecture layer-by-layer (Conv blocks, MaxPool, FC layers) without using torchvision.models or applications.VGG19.

        Training: Train this model from random initialization. Note: This requires significant GPU time and careful hyperparameter tuning (learning rate scheduling) to avoid vanishing gradients.

    Documentation: Write the "VGG-19 Architecture" section, explaining the stack of 3×3 filters, and the Pros/Cons of deep plain networks.

### Member 3: The Multi-Model Specialist (Inception & MobileNet/ViT)
|--->Done by :   Omar Wagih      
    Primary Responsibility: Transfer Learning for Inception and the 4th Model.

    Technical Tasks:

        Inception V1: Implement Transfer Learning on Inception V1 (GoogLeNet). Handle the auxiliary classifiers if present in the pre-trained version.

        Model 4 Choice: Implement Vision Transformer (ViT) (Recommended for high performance) OR MobileNet (Recommended if compute resources are low). Use Transfer Learning.

    Documentation: Write the sections for "Inception V1" (Inception modules) and the chosen 4th model. Explain the concept of Transfer Learning in the report.

### Member 4: The Evaluation Lead
|--->Done by :    Ali Achraf     
 --->   Primary Responsibility: Metrics Logic & Scoring.

    Technical Tasks:

        Evaluation Script: Write a robust Python script that takes any of the 4 trained models and calculates:

            Accuracy (Top-1 and Top-5).

            Precision, Recall, and F1​-Score (Macro-averaged due to class imbalance).

        ROC/AUC: Implement the logic to calculate the AUC and generate the data points for ROC curves for multi-class classification (One-vs-Rest approach).

    Documentation: Write the "Evaluation Methodology" section, defining the formulas for all metrics used.

### Member 5: The Visualization Expert
|--->Done by :   Rawan Hicham          
  --->Primary Responsibility: Visualizing Results & Performance.

    Technical Tasks:

        Confusion Matrix: Create detailed heatmaps of the Confusion Matrices (focusing on the most confused classes).

        ROC Curves: Plot the ROC curves generated by Member 4's data.

        Training Graphs: Plot Loss vs. Epoch and Accuracy vs. Epoch for all 4 models on one comparative graph.

    Documentation: Generate all figures for the final report and write the "Comparative Analysis" section (interpreting the graphs).

### Member 6: The Research Lead & Integrator
|--->Done by:   Omar Attia              
  --->Primary Responsibility: Literature Review, Documentation compilation, and formatting.

    Technical Tasks:

        Literature Review: Locate and summarize the 4 original papers (references below).

        Pros & Cons: Aggregate the pros/cons for each architecture based on the team's findings (e.g., VGG is heavy, MobileNet is fast, ViT is data-hungry).

        Final Report: Compile all sections from members into the final document/PDF. Ensure consistent formatting, bibliography, and introduction/conclusion.
